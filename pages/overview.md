## SFS@BAMA: Shaping the Next Generation of Cyber Professionals

SFS@BAMA is a trans-disciplinary scholarship program for students interested in careers in cyber security-related professions (examples include, but are not limited to the following: Network Attack, Network Defense, Cyber Crime Investigation, Cyber Ops Planner, Security Architect, Cyber Policy and Strategy Manager).
The SFS@BAMA [NSF-1946599](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1946599&HistoricalAwards=false) program seeks to address the growing national need for highly-trained, well-rounded cyber security professionals by recruiting a diverse set of scholars from three academic programs at the University of Alabama: [Computer Science](http://cs.ua.edu/), [Cyber Security](http://cs.ua.edu/undergraduate/bachelor-science-cyber-security/), [Criminology and Criminal Justice](http://cj.ua.edu/), and [Management Information Systems](https://ism.culverhouse.ua.edu/).
Students who receive an SFS@BAMA scholarship will participate in a summer internship and become part of the Federal CyberCorpsÂ®, whose mission is to ensure the protection of critical U.S. government infrastructure. Upon graduation, SFS@BAMA scholars are required to serve in a paid cyber security position in the government for a period equal to the length of the scholarship.
The SFS@BAMA program provides support for identifying potential summer internships as well as the post-graduation position.
